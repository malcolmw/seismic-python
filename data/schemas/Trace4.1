Schema Trace4.1
	Description ( "Trace Manipulation and Processing Database" )
	Detail {
		This database provides the parameter
		information needed during standard processing of 
		seismic waveform data.
		
		It is largely derived from the CSS 3.1 database, 
		with additions which address specific trace manipulation
		issues, and the representation of traces in memory.  
		The information contained in the central
		trace relation represents a join of many tables, 
		in particular wfdisc, site, sitechan, sensor and instrument.

		This is an update to the Trace4.0 schema to bew compatible
		with the various larger strings in css3.1

	Description ( "database pointer to bundled/grouped traces" )
	Detail {
		Abundle is a special database pointer which refers to
		either an entire table or view, or to a contiguous subset
		of some table or view.  In the former case, both the record
		number and the field number should be dbALL.  In the latter
		case, the record number and the field number specify a
		range of records in the table.

		This is the standard deviation of
		the accompanying magnitude measurement.
	}

Attribute upper
	Integer (20)
	Format ( "%20ld" )
	Description ( "upper confidence estimate" )
	Detail {
		pointer to the vector of upper confidence levels, ie

Attribute vang
	Real (6)
	Format ( "%6.1f" )
	Null ( "0.0" )
	Range ( "vang >= 0.0 && vang <= 90.0" )
	Units ( "Degrees" )
	Description ( "vertical angle" )
	Detail {
		This attribute
		measures the angle between the sensitive axis of a
		seismometer and the outward-pointing vertical direction.
		For a vertically oriented seismometer, vang = 0. For a
		horizontally oriented seismometer, vang =90. See hang.
	}

Attribute variance
	Real (20)
	Format ( "%20.12le" )
	Null ( "-1.000000000000e+00" )
	Range ( "variance >= 0.0" )
	Description ( "calculated variance of trace data" )
	Detail {
		Variance of input data, ie sum of squares of data values, 
		divided by number of samples.
	}
	;

Attribute vmodel
	String (30)
	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "velocity model" )
	Detail {
		This character string identifies the
		velocity model of the earth used to compute the travel
		times of seismic phases. These are required for event
		location (if phase is defining) or for computing
		travel-time residuals.
	}
	;

Attribute weights
	Integer (20)
	Format ( "%20ld" )
	Description ( "adaptive weights" )
	Detail {
		pointer to the array of adapative weights for all tapers, ie
		the nth weight for taper j is 
		    *(weight + j * nfft + n),  c
		or
		    weight(n,j)    FORTRAN
	}
	;

Attribute wgt
	Real (6)
	Format ( "%6.3f" )
	Null ( "-1.000" )
	Range ( "wgt >= 0.0 && wgt < 1.0" )
	Description ( "location weight" )
	Detail {
		This attribute gives the final weight
		assigned to the allied arrival by the location program. It
		is used primarily for location programs that adaptively
		weight data by their residuals.
	}

Relation lastid
	Fields (  keyname keyvalue )
	Primary (  keyname )
	Transient
	Description ( "Counter values (Last value used for keys)" )
	Detail {
		This relation
		is a reference table from which programs may retrieve the
		last sequential value of one of the numeric keys. Unique
		keys are required before inserting a record in numerous
		tables. The table has exactly one row for each keyname. In
		the core schema there are just 9 distinct identifier keys:
		arid, chanid, commid, evid, inid, magid, orid, stassid,
		wfid. This table will also support application-specific
		keys as needed. Users are encouraged to use the
		dbgetcounter library routine to obtain a counter value.
